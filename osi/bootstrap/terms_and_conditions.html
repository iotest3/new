            ("<strong>you</strong>") and Open Society Institute ("<strong>OSI</strong>,"
            "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>") concerning your use of the KARL network

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Acceptance of Terms.</strong> The Site is made available by OSI subject to this
            Agreement. We reserve the right to update or make changes to this Agreement from time to
            time in our sole discretion, which changes we may provide to you by any reasonable
            means, including without limitation, by posting the revised version of this Agreement on
            the Site. You can determine when this Agreement was last revised by referring to the
            "LAST UPDATED" legend at the top of this Agreement. When using any Services (as defined
            below), you agree that you are subject to any additional posted guidelines, rules, terms
            and conditions applicable to such Services, which are hereby incorporated by reference
            into this Agreement. <p>We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time,
                temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, to: modify or discontinue the Site,
                with or without notice; charge fees in connection with the use of the Site; modify
                and/or waive any fees charged in connection with the Site; and/or offer

                party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Site, in whole or in
                part, or of any Service, content, feature or product offered through the Site. Your
                continued use of the Site after such changes will indicate your acceptance of such
                changes.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Jurisdictional Issues</strong>. The Site is controlled and operated by OSI from
            the United States, and is not intended to subject OSI to the laws or jurisdiction of any
            state, country or territory other than that of the United States. OSI does not represent
            or warrant that the Site or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any
            particular jurisdiction other than the United States. Those who choose to access the
            Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for
            complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. You are also subject to United
            States export controls and are responsible for any violations of such controls,
            including any United States embargoes or other federal rules and regulations restricting
            exports. We may limit the Site's availability, in whole or in part, to any person,
            geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>


        <li><strong>Registration; User Names and Passwords</strong>. You may be required to register
            with OSI in order to access certain Services or areas of the Site. With respect to any
            such registration, we may refuse to grant you, and you may not use, a user name (or
            e-mail address) that is already being used by someone else; that may be construed as
            impersonating another person; that belongs to another person; that violates the
            intellectual property or other rights of any person; that is offensive; or that we
            reject for any other reason in our sole discretion. <p>Your user name and password are
                for your personal use only, and not for use by any other person. You are responsible
                for maintaining the confidentiality of any password you may use to access the Site,
                and agree not to transfer your password or user name, or lend or otherwise transfer
                your use of or access to the Site, to any third party. You are fully responsible for
                all interaction with the Site that occurs in connection with your password or user
                name. You agree to immediately notify OSI of any unauthorized use of your password
                or user name or any other breach of security related to your account or the Site,
                and to ensure that you "log off"/exit from your account with the Site (if
                applicable) at the end of each session. We are not liable for any loss or damage
                arising from your failure to comply with any of the foregoing obligations.</p></li>


        <li><strong>Profiles and Forums</strong>. You may post certain information and materials on
            your "profile page" (your "<strong>Profile</strong>"). In addition, we and/or our third
            party service provider(s) may make available through the Site services (for example,
            message boards and forums, among other services) to which you are able to post
            information and materials (each, a "<strong>Forum</strong>"). <p>Information contained
                in the Profiles and Forums may be provided by employees of OSI and the Affiliated
                Entities as well as third party visitors to the Site. Please note that employees of
                OSI or an Affiliated Entity are not required to use the Forums, and that any
                messages or materials that such employees post to the Forums or otherwise make
                available through the Site. Users of the Site who happen to be employees of OSI or
                an Affiliated Entity are considered to be third party Site visitors for the purposes
                of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>Please note that Site visitors may post messages or make statements in connection
                with Profiles and/or Forums that are inaccurate, misleading or deceptive. OSI and
                the Affiliated Entities neither endorse nor are responsible for any opinion, advice,
                information or statements made in Profiles and/or Forums by third parties. Without
                limitation, OSI and the Affiliated Entities are not responsible for any information
                or materials made available through Profiles and/or Forums (including without
                limitation errors or omissions in postings or links or images embedded in messages)
                or results obtained by using any such information or materials. Under no
                circumstances will OSI, the Affiliated Entities or their respective sponsors,
                employees, officers, directors, shareholders, affiliates, agents, representatives,
                suppliers or members, be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on
                such information or materials. The opinions expressed in Profiles and/or Forums
                reflect solely the opinions of the individuals who submitted such opinions, and may
                not reflect the opinions of OSI.</p>
            <p>In addition, OSI and the Affiliated Entities have no control over, and shall have no
                liability for, any damages resulting from, the use (including without limitation
                republication) or misuse by any third party of information voluntarily made public
                through your Profile, a Forum or any other part of the Site. IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE
                ANY OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE OR OTHER INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN A
                PROFILE OR A FORUM OR OTHERWISE ON THE SITE, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
        </li>


        <li><strong>License</strong>. For purposes of clarity, you will retain ownership of any
            materials that you submit through or to your Profile, a Forum, or otherwise through the
            Site (each, a "<strong>Submission</strong>"). You hereby grant to OSI, the Affiliated
            Entities and their designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free,
            perpetual, irrevocable right and license, without compensation to you: (a) to use,
            reproduce, distribute, adapt (including without limitation edit, modify, translate, and
            reformat), create derivative works of, transmit, publicly display and publicly perform
            such Submission, in any media now known or hereafter developed, for OSI's and the
            Affiliated Entities' business purposes, and (b) to sublicense the foregoing rights,
            through multiple tiers, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. For each
            Submission, you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary for you to
            grant the license granted in this section, and that such Submission, and your provision
            thereof to and through the Site, complies with all applicable laws, rules and
            regulations.</li>


        <li><strong>License-Back</strong>. here are certain items of so-called "wiki" content
            available through the Site that are created collaboratively by members of the Site
            community. If you submit material to such wiki content, your submission of such material
            is governed by the license set forth in Section 8 above. In addition, subject to your
            compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, OSI hereby grants to you a
            limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the wiki content to which you have
            submitted material (the "<strong>Licensed-Back Content</strong>") solely for
            non-commercial purposes during the term of this Agreement, provided that you keep intact
            all copyright and other proprietary notices, and that you not provide attribution to
            OSI, except upon request by OSI. Upon any such request, you shall provide attribution to
            OSI, using any wording requested by OSI, and by utilizing a method of attribution that
            is reasonable to the medium you are using. Upon termination of this Agreement, this
            license to you shall also terminate. Please note that the Licensed-Back Content is
            provided to you "AS IS" without any representations or warranties of any kind, as
            further set forth in Section 16 below. You agree that any use by you of such
            Licensed-Back Content is at your own risk. In addition, if you do choose to use any
            Licensed-Back Content licensed to you hereunder, you must disclaim all representations
            and warranties with respect to such Licensed-Back Content, and state that such
            Licensed-Back Content is provided "AS IS." The disclaimer you use must be at least as
            robust as the language set forth in Section 16 below. Further, you may not distort,
            mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Licensed-Back
            Content which would be prejudicial to OSI's and/or the original author(s)' honor or
            reputation.</li>


        <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>. You acknowledge and agree that (a) we reserve the right
            (but have no obligation) to evaluate each Submission before allowing it to be posted on
            the Site or any Forum; and (b) we may do one or all of the following, at our discretion:
            (i) monitor Submissions; (ii) alter, remove, or refuse to post or allow to be posted any
            Submission; and/or (iii) disclose any Submissions, and the circumstances surrounding
            their transmission, to any third party in order to operate the Site; to protect OSI, the
            Affiliated Entities, and their respective sponsors, employees, officers, directors,
            shareholders, affiliates, agents, representatives, suppliers and members, and the Site's
            users and visitors; to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests; to
            enforce this Agreement; or for any other reason or purpose.</li>


        <li><strong>Confidential Information</strong>. Any Submissions posted on the Site and
            designated as "private" or "confidential" (either at the time of posting or
            subsequently) will be considered confidential information of OSI ("<strong>Confidential
                Information</strong>"). You will not disclose the Confidential Information to a
            third party without the prior, written consent of OSI. Any copies of Confidential
            Information that you are authorized to make must contain the same notice that appears on
            and in the Confidential Information obtained under this Agreement. In cases of highly
            sensitive Confidential Information, we may impose further restrictions, such as limiting
            the right to copy or store the information. You will notify us of any disclosure of
            Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement, and you will cooperate with us
            in remedying any such disclosure. These confidentiality restrictions do not apply to
            information that is or becomes public knowledge without breach of this Agreement.</li>


        <li><strong>Online Listings</strong>. We may allow you to post online listings, such as
            items for sale, in the Forums. Please note that we allow users to provide listings in
            connection with the Forums for our users' convenience. We are not responsible for the
            actions or inactions of our users in connection with such listings. You acknowledge and
            agree that we are not responsible for the accuracy, reliability, quality or legality of
            the content of any listing made available in connection with the Forums, and that we are
            not involved in any transactions that occur through the Forums and have no
            responsibility for such transactions (or for any failure of a transaction to occur). We
            cannot and do not guarantee that users will be able to pay for or provide the products
            and services that are listed on the Forums. You acknowledge and agree that we have no
            responsibility to you or any third party for any transaction that occurs (or fails to
            occur) through the Forums. You should use discretion and caution in engaging in
            transactions through the Forums. YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF OR RESPONSE TO ANY LISTINGS IN
            CONNECTION WITH THE FORUMS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.</li>

        <p>While we try to maintain the integrity and security of the Site and the servers from
            which the Site is operated, we do not guarantee that the Site will be or remain secure,
            complete or correct, or that access to the Site will be uninterrupted. The Site may
            include inaccuracies, errors and materials that violate or conflict with this Agreement.
            Additionally, third parties may make unauthorized alterations to the Site. If you become

        <li><strong>Indemnity</strong>. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless OSI and the
            Affiliated Entities and their respective sponsors, employees, officers, directors,
            shareholders, affiliates, agents, representatives, suppliers and members, from and
            against all claims, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) arising out of
            (a) your use of, or activities in connection with, the Site; or (b) any violation of
            this Agreement by you or anyone using your username and/or password.</li>


        <li><strong>Termination</strong>. This Agreement is effective until terminated. OSI, in its
            sole discretion, may terminate your access to or use of the Site, at any time and for
            any reason, including if OSI believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently
            with the letter or spirit of this Agreement. Upon any such termination, your right to
            use the Site will immediately cease. You agree that any termination of your access to or
            use of the Site may be effected without prior notice, and that OSI may immediately
            deactivate or delete your password and user name, and all related information and files
            associated with it, and/or bar any further access to such information or files. You
            agree that OSI and the Affiliated Entities shall not be liable to you or any third party
            for any termination of your access to the Site or to any such information or files, and
            shall not be required to make such information or files available to you after any such

        <li><strong>Governing Law; Jurisdiction</strong>. This Agreement is governed by and shall be
            construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., without regards
            to its principles of conflicts of law. You agree to exclusive jurisdiction by the
            federal and state courts located in the County of New York in the State of New York,
            U.S.A., and waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such
            courts.</li>


        <li><strong>Claims of Copyright Infringement</strong>. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act
            of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material
            appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you
            believe in good faith that materials available on the Site infringe your copyright, you
            (or your agent) may send OSI a notice requesting that OSI remove the material or block
            access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of
            copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send OSI a counter-notice.
            Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by
            the DMCA. See http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices should
            be sent to: R. Castro, Open Society Institute, 400 West 59th Street, New York, NY 10019,
            +1-212-548-0600.</li>

        <p>We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or
            counter-notice.</p>

        <li><strong>Contact Us</strong>. If you have any questions regarding the meaning of
            application of this Agreement, please direct such questions to karladmin@list.soros.org.
            Please note that e-mail communications will not necessarily be secure; accordingly you
            should not include credit card information or other sensitive information in your e-mail
            correspondence with us.</li>


        <li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>. This Agreement does not, and shall not be construed to,
            create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or
            franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and OSI. If any provision of this
            Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision
            will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and
            enforceability of any remaining provision. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense
            any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express prior
            written consent. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder will be
            deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading,
            caption or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience,
            and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. This, together with
            all policies referred to herein, is the entire Agreement between you and OSI relating to
            the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or
            oral agreements or understandings between you and OSI relating to such subject matter.
            Notices to you may be made via posting to the Site, by e-mail, or by regular mail, in
            OSI's discretion. The Site may also provide notices of changes to this Agreement or
            other matters by displaying such notices or by providing links to such notices. Without
            limitation, you agree that a printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given
            in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based
            upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions
            as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed
            form. OSI will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any obligations due to causes
            beyond its control.</li>
